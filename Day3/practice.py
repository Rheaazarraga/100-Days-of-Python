# Coding Rooms, Interactive Coding Exercises

# Exercise 1: Odd or Even
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore, the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")

# Exercise 2:
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)
# Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
# Remember to round your result to the nearest whole number.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

bmi = round(weight / height ** 2)

if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi <30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
