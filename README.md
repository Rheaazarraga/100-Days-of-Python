---

As part of my journey to become a polyglot developer, I decided to take a course to help me learn Python. It involves:

- A series of fundamental exercises created by [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer)
- Found in her course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- A fun and engaging introduction to Python
- An abundance of resources to help students learn the ins and outs of the language
- Build 100 projects in 100 days

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Day 1 :

An introduction to Python basics. Variables and string manipulation, concatenation, printing, and inputs. The project was to allow the user to input some data to the console to help them create a new band name.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Day 2 :

Data types, Numbers, Operations, Type Conversion, f-Strings. The lessons went over PEMDAS for proper calculations and introduced the round() function, and the format() function. The project for the day was to create a tip calculator which would determine each person's bill total, including the tip.
