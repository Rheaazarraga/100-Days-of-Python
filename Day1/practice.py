print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

# Exercise 2: Debugging Practice

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
string = input("What is your name?")
print(len(string))

# Exercise 4: Variables
# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a & b
# Do not change the code on lines 27-28 & 41-42. Your program should work for different inputs e.g. any value of a & b
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
