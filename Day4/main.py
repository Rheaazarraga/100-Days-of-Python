# Randomisation

# deterministic - like computers, performs repeatable actions in a predictable way - pseudorandom number generator -  produced by an algorithm that generates a series of bits that appear unpredictable, but in fact are computed from an algorithm
# nondeterministic - a nondeterministic function may return different results every time it is called, even when the same input values are provided - a truly random number is a number selected from a range with each number in the range having equal and completely unpredictable chance of selection
# python uses the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)
