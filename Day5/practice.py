# Coding Rooms, Interactive Coding Exercises

# Exercise 1: Average Height
# Write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# ** Important** You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer
# You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Hint: Remember to use the round() function to round the average height before you print it

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
print(total_height)

number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
    number_of_students += 1 # ensures that the for loop iterates as many times as there are items in the list aka list length
print(number_of_students)

average_height_of_students = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(average_height_of_students)

# Exercise 2: Highest Score
# Write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
# **Important** you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
# Output: "The highest score in the class is: x"

# Hint: Think about the logic first: How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > highest_score:
        highest_score = score
print(f"The highest score is: {highest_score}")
