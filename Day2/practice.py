# Coding Rooms, Interactive Coding Exercises

# Exercise 1: Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# 1. check the data type of two_digit_number
print(type(two_digit_number)) # string type

# 2. Get the first and second digits by grabbing the index of each, then convert str to int
first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])
# 3. Add the 2 digits together
print(first_digit + second_digit)

# Exercise 2: Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
